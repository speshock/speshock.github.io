intro: |
  I am a graduate of Virginia Tech's Master of Information Technology program excited about starting a career in the tech industry. I have primarily worked with Python and enjoy Machine Learning and IoT projects.  While completing my degree, I worked on Artificial Intelligence and computure vision projects.  Most recently,  I worked to create a traffic light detection algorithm using a Faster Inception V2 R-CNN model.  I have also engaged in Java development using the JVM to make simple interactive games like tetris and Adventure. <br/><br/>
  My two main focusses are Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.  I want to eventually bridge the gap between those two interests as a career.  My other interest is harnessing databases to improve business intelligence with analytics.<br/><br/>
  I currently am a Graduate Assistant at Virginia Tech and will be a Distance Learning Instructor for a Healthcare Database Course being taught at Virginia Tech during Summer 2020.

   <strong>Java</strong>: I am familiar with Java Test Driven Development using JUnit along with a number of other Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. My IDE of choice is Eclipse. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Python</strong> I have used Python for a number of different use-cases.  Some examples include funneling data between Excel Sheets and a MySQL database, networking applications like video streaming, Machine Learning applications, creating rainbow tables, and much more.  It is my go to programming language to solve tasks. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Tensorflow</strong>: I have primarily used Tensorflow for ML projects focussing on object detection using my own system. An example would be the creation of a model that I tweaked that can detect traffic lights in real time running on a Raspberry pi.<br/><br/>
#   <strong>Web Development</strong>: Through building web applications, I have also worked with various client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Backbone/Underscore/Require. More recently I have written React applications (primarily using the Create React App framework, and extending them)<br/><br/>
#   <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
#   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/AWS. <br/><br/>
#   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">https://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
#   I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
